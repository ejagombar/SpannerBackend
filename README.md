# Spanner

Visit site here:  https://spanner.eagombar.uk  As I do not have a full Spotify Developer Key, the website is only able to display my stats. The modified code for this can be found on the "SingleUser" branch.

Spanner is a Spotify Analyser website. It allows you to view your top tracks and artists and analyse playlists.
Spanner is currently undergoing the verification process with Spotify to access the Public API. Once this is approved, the website can be made live.

This Repository hosts the backend code, written in Go.

The frontend, written in Typescript, can be found here: https://github.com/ejagombar/SpannerFrontend

## Project Info
I decided to undertake this project in order to learn more about web development and APIs, as well as develop my Go knowledge and learn some Typescript and React. Although this project took longer than expected, I have learnt a log and I plan to add more features in the future.

Some things that are to be added in the future are:
 - Lyric Sentiment Analysis
 - Metrics and Server Error Alerts
 - Playlist Comparison
